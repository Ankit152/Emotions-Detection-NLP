### Problem Defination ü§î
Given a `sentence` by the user we have to predict the `emotion` relevant to it.

What is the sentiment of your customer comment?
What is the mood of today's special food ?

### Business Constraints ‚úîÔ∏è
* To predict the right `emotion` for each sentence with very `high accuracy` and `high F1 score`.
* `Incorrect emotion` can lead to some `misunderstanding` with your loved ones. Also if used for business it can highly affect customer experience.
* No strict latency requirements. The model should be able to predict the emotion within a few seconds(1-3).


### Data üóÑÔ∏è
* `Train.txt` = 1.58 MB
* `Val.txt` = 200 KB
* `Test.txt` = 202 KB
